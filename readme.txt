Easily and Simply show and hide what is in your admin nav. That's it.

== Description ==

Ever get tired of seeing the same menu options you literally never use? Or setting up a WordPress install for a client, and want to get rid of the stuff they don’t use, or would screw up if they could?

Us too. So we made this handy little plugin that gives you little checkboxes next to each menu item and sub-menu item, even for other plugins! Just uncheck the items you don’t want to see anymore, and they’re gone! When you need them again, just recheck and they’re back! No editing core files, and being over-written upon upgrade.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `simple-admin-menu-editor` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. A new menu item, Admin Menu Editor, will show up under Settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
